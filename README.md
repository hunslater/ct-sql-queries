# SQL scripts used for J.C.'s CT Monitor

These scripts are used by https://ct.tacticalsecret.com/ to produce the statistics reported there
about the state of the Web PKI.

Queries in `Maintenance-Weekly` are expected to be run once per week, and queries in `Maintenance-Nightly` are run once per night. Queries in `Setup` are run to initialize the database, and as-needed by the administrator.
